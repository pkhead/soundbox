- Undo/redo
    - Undo/redo on text fields (imgui has its own undo/redo for that so conflict?)
      names also don't affect song output so undo/redo for that is possibly undesirable
    - Undo/redo for module modification (research how lv2 and clap handles control changes)
- alternative FX mixer ui
    - always once selected FX bus, add another docked window called "FX Bus"
- Variable-length patterns (useful mainly for audio clips/sampling)
- metronome
- try not to use spinlocks (used for lv2 port subscription)
- figure out why keyboard interactions do not work sometimes with plugin UI embedding enabled
- mp3 exports
- Plugin support (VST, CLAP)
- Automation
- unit tests? how to do that though?
- Channel for playing audio clips
- Song change markers (time signature or tuning)
- Synths
    - FM (possibly incorporated into waveform synth?)
    - harmonics
    - noise (possibly incorporated into waveform synth?)
    - sampler
    - slicer
- Effects
    - mono/stereo converter (similar to calf mono input)
    - equalizer
        - show frequency response, configurable bandwidth
    - distortion
    - bitcrusher/downsampler
    - chrous
    - flanger
    - phaser
    - reverb
