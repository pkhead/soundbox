= Undo/redo
    - Undo/redo on text fields (imgui has its own undo/redo for that so conflict?)
      names also don't affect song output so undo/redo for that is possibly undesirable
    - Undo/redo for module modification (research how lv2 and clap handles control changes)

- alternative FX mixer ui
    - always once selected FX bus, add another docked window called "FX Bus"

= Unit tests
    = module serialization
    = ring buffer
    x message queue
    x util functions
    - sys.h
    - song.h
    - ui Vec2

- Plugin support
    = LV2
        - serialization
        - pretty sure there are some bugs
    - VST
    - CLAP

- Synths
    x basic waveform
    - "synthbox" synthesizer
        waveform + fm
    - harmonics
    - spectrum
    - noise (although probably part of synthbox)
    - sampler
    - slicer

- Effects
    - mono/stereo converter (similar to calf mono input)
        - then, remove unused interlacing feature in LADSPA impl
    = echo
        - rewrite to use DelayLine class
    x limiter
    x compressor
    = equalizer
        - show frequency response, configurable bandwidth
    - distortion
    - bitcrusher/downsampler
    - chrous
    - flanger
    - phaser
    = reverb

- !! IMPORTANT !! why tf does it crash when i open double-drums.box, export it, then exit the program??

- module garbage collection is kind of stupid (in that it's very memory-unsafe)
  make a safer one.
- more memory-safety (prefer std::unique_ptr instead of new directly)
- don't use native file browser
    (port the file browser i made with imgui/love2d to C++)
- Importing MIDI tracks
- figure out why keyboard interactions do not work sometimes with plugin UI embedding enabled
- mp3 exports
- Automation
- Channel for playing audio clips
- Song change markers (time signature or tuning)
- Variable-length patterns (useful mainly for audio clips/sampling)
- metronome
- try not to use spinlocks (used for lv2 port subscription)
x use ring buffer for message queue
- thin out main.cpp
