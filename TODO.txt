= Undo/redo
    - Undo/redo on text fields (imgui has its own undo/redo for that so conflict?)
      names also don't affect song output so undo/redo for that is possibly undesirable
    - Undo/redo for module modification (research how lv2 and clap handles control changes)

- alternative FX mixer ui
    - always once selected FX bus, add another docked window called "FX Bus"
    - horizontal fx mixer layout

= Unit tests
    = module serialization
    = ring buffer
    x message queue
    x util functions
    - sys.h
    - song.h
    - ui Vec2

- Plugin support
    = LV2
        - serialization
        - Exampler crashes when press "Request Sample"
          (this is because i did not implement the request value feature)
        - investigate memory leak when loading lv2 plugins
        - investigate why Exampler ui doesn't update with ui embedding enabled
        - toggle between plugin ui and control ui
        - pretty sure there are some bugs
    - VST3
    - CLAP

- Synths
    x basic waveform
    - omnisynth
        essentially goldbox's advanced fm
    - fluidsynth (.sf2 support)
    - (possibly?) port ZynAddSubFx
    - harmonics
    - spectrum
    - noise (although probably part of omnisybth)
    - sampler
    - slicer

- Effects
    - mono/stereo converter (similar to calf mono input)
        - then, remove unused interlacing feature in LADSPA impl
    = echo
        - rewrite to use DelayLine class
    x limiter
    x compressor
    = equalizer
        x show frequency response
        - configurable bandwidth
    - distortion
    - bitcrusher/downsampler
    - chrous
    - flanger
    - phaser
    = reverb

- Automation
- Importing MIDI tracks
- mp3 exports
- Automation
- Channel for playing audio clips
- Song change markers (time signature or tuning)
- Variable-length patterns (useful mainly for audio clips/sampling)
- metronome
- presets

    TEMPORARY TODOS:

- use std::filesystem::path for all path types, instead of std::string
- RingBuffer/MessageQueue can make write handles(?)
x more memory-safety (prefer std::unique_ptr instead of new directly)
- create default dock layout in code
- don't use native file browser
    (port the file browser i made with imgui/love2d to C++)
- figure out why keyboard interactions do not work sometimes with plugin UI embedding enabled
- try not to use spinlocks (used for lv2 port subscription)
x use ring buffer for message queue
- move all util classes/functions into a util namespace
- make audio rendering realtime-capable
  (kind of hard, since it's (1.) an extra thread that (2.) can't do memory de/allocation)
- logs. used for plugins and debugging (including debugging for file loading)
